                    At first, photography was just a hobby that consisted of taking a camera, photographing friend's parties at their homes, and posting the photos on social media the next day. At the time people liked the photos a lot and started reposting them on their profiles, which motivated Carter to start studying and go deeper into photography.
                    Exposure, focus, depth of field, light play, techniques and more techniques, new equipment... This and another series of things awakened, even more, the desire that Carter had to “throw himself” into the photography world. <br>
                    In 2013, Carter started professionally photographing clubs and that was the moment he began to conquer his space as he gained more experience.
                    Carter developed his own style, starting Carter Photography, synonymous with photos with a unique and irreverent identity.
                    We know that once you have a name, things get serious, and as soon as that happened our work kept increasing. Requests to photograph concerts, graduations, editorials, gastronomy, and products started to come frequently. <br>
                    In 2020 Natalie joined the team, bringing a new concept and style for the photos. Thereby, we orientated our 13 years of photography excellence just to gastronomy and weddings.
